# My Protfolio Website
Repository for my own website available at [https://maximepico.com](https://maximepico.com)

Please take a look at how I built the CO2 counter and find out how to reduce your own website's own impact by studying mine.

I chose not to use any frameworks and code only in Vanilla JS in order to reduce the need for dependencies. I had that luxury because it's a simple website.

I compressed images using https://squoosh.app/

I tested the efficiency of the website thanks to:

- [Website Carbon: https://www.websitecarbon.com/](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)
- [The Google Pagespeed Tool https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
